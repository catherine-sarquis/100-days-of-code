        <ul>
          <li>Finished the design for this simple log page, drawing inspiration from the
            neu-brutalist designs of the GumRoad and Codecademy sites. Aiming for a clean, readable layout.</li>
          <li>Completed a kata in Python and JS: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/555086d53eac039a2a000083"

        <p>Learnt about css variables, and managed to include some into this repo's css!</p>

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed a few lessons about Python - learnt a bit about binary, converted strings of binary into integers,
          learnt a bit about exponents and scientific notation.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Definitely need to practice these concepts more, maybe can find some codewars katas related to these areas.

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>In this hot weather, having short Boot.dev lesson to work through make it easier to meet my goal of learning
          code for at
          least an hour a day. Worked through the "Comparisons" chapter in Python.</p>

        <img src="src/img/day-3.png" alt="A screen capture of checking conditions in Python" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I wouldn't usually have written the code as above, but
          I'm glad that I passed the tests for the exercise as it didn't come naturally to me to write it in one concise
          line.<br>
          I was surprised that the solution provided had the if statements listed separately and with no if-else
          statements.
          Apparently, this is known as the "early exit" pattern and is recommended for readability and makes it easier
          to maintain code.

        <p>90 mins on Boot.dev working through the first Python course, I'm finding the exercises great practice &

        <p>Completed the Python course section on Lists</p>

        <img src="src/img/day 5.png" alt="A screenshot of Lists lessons completed" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>In addition to practicing iterating over and slicing lists, I learnt about tuples and that they should only
          be used for a handful of items, otherwise a class or dictionary might be more suitable due to the information
          becoming harder to read the larger the tuples are. </p>

      <h2>Day 6 <span class="date">- 4 July, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed the first Python course on Boot.dev!</p>

        <img src="src/img/day-6.png" alt="A screenshot of Python course completed" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I'm finding that the most valuable learning moments often come <em>after</em> I've submitted my code, when
          I
          compare my approach to the suggested solutions. It's clear that my next step in development is to move from
          just 'making it work' to 'making it elegant'.<br><br>

          The AI chat (Boots) has proven very helpful throughout these lessons as it has access to the lesson content,
          your own solution and a suggested solution. Today, the AI chat tool told me about the simple | operator that
          merges two sets in a single character!<br><br>

          My following chat with the AI tool suggested an approach that I'll test out going forwards: Focus on
          identifying the core, uniform pattern of a task first, then handling the specifics or bugs afterwards. It
          suggested that this "general-to-specific" approach will help me write less redundant code. </p>

      <h2>Day 7 <span class="date">- 5 July, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Applied more Bootstrap techniques learn from the SheCodes course and completed the WSL2 setup for the
          upcoming Boot.dev course - I had nothing to be afraid of!</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Getting into Bootstrap, I'm realising how much more pratice I need in understanding documentation. There have
          been some details I've wanted to customise, but haven't figured out from the documentation how to
          achieve them in Bootstrap. I want to be able to refer solely to the documentation and not resort to asking AI
          or searching elsewhere for help; if I find myself needing or wanting to use Bootstrap in the future, I will
          need to dedicate time in experimenting with their classes, but for now I will just focus on getting
          enough done for completing the SheCodes course.
          <br><br>
          For developers that are familiar with Bootstrap, I can see how it would be a great tool for quickly getting a
          site up.

        <p>Limited for time today, but spent an hour working through some SheCodes lessons. I wanted to try to complete
          a challenge in the last 30 minutes I had to spare:</p>

        <p>I didn't manage to complete the challenge in the 30 minutes, and need to return to it tomorrow.

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>In today's session I chose to continue with my 'terminal journey' on boot.dev. I learnt about the
          10-character strings that indicate file permissions, and that you can chain options/commands (for lack of a
          better
          word) such as: <code>ls -l -d private/</code></p>

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Learnt a bit about what compiled and interpreted programs are, shell scripts and adding scripts to the PATH
          so that they
          can be easily accessed without remembering their location.</p>
        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>So many new commands were covered today, I need need to find a pretty cheatsheet with examples of them in
          use.</p>

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Made a start on a guided python project in Boot.dev, and opened up Figma to start wireframing a redesign for
          my portfolio. </p>

        <img src="src/img/day-14.png" alt="A screenshot of portfolio wireframe progress" />
        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>A LOT of time was spent browsing ideas, but I tend to prefer the "neu-brutalist" style. I
          personally have a strong dislike for scrolling, so the portfolio has to be non-scrollable... maybe I'll
          brainstorm
          ways of making this log non-scrollable too... or is it possible to auto-scroll? a vertical carousel?</p>
