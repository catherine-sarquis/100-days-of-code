        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Tested myself on some basic JS exercises as a start to this new challenge. These were planned practice
          exercises from a course I'm working through. <br><br> I found that a variable set to <strong>null</strong> has
          an object type. Due to this historical mistake in the language's design, it's not reliable to check for
          <strong>null</strong> by using <strong>typeof</strong>. A better way to check if a variable is
          <strong>null</strong> is to use a strict equality comparison.

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Spent an hour or so working through exercises with different loops and logical operators.

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Went back to a previous tutorial about using the debugger in VS Code - I couldn't get this working before,
          but I've learnt how to do this now so I can play some more with this tool!

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Worked through a few exercises today, focusing on converting regular JavaScript functions into arrow
          functions.

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Worked through some exercises on array methods, and completed the bonus challenge using methods that I've
          struggled using in the past!</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Today I've seen the benefit of the practice exercises, I didn't have to look up the method usage, and even
          though I feel I don't understand arrow functions or map, I managed to write both from my brain and prepend
          light to each array item!</p>

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>I worked on some object methods exercises which were new to me: Object.keys(), Object.values(),
          objectName.hasOwnProperty("price") for checking if a key exists, and Object.fromEntries(array) which creates
          an object from an array of key, value pairs. </p>
