        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed a few lessons about Python - learnt a bit about binary, converted strings of binary into integers,
          learnt a bit about exponents and scientific notation.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Definitely need to practice these concepts more, maybe can find some codewars katas related to these areas.

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>In this hot weather, having short Boot.dev lesson to work through make it easier to meet my goal of learning
          code for at
          least an hour a day. Worked through the "Comparisons" chapter in Python.</p>

        <img src="src/img/day-3.png" alt="A screen capture of checking conditions in Python" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I wouldn't usually have written the code as above, but
          I'm glad that I passed the tests for the exercise as it didn't come naturally to me to write it in one concise
          line.<br>
          I was surprised that the solution provided had the if statements listed separately and with no if-else
          statements.
          Apparently, this is known as the "early exit" pattern and is recommended for readability and makes it easier
          to maintain code.

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>In addition to practicing iterating over and slicing lists, I learnt about tuples and that they should only
          be used for a handful of items, otherwise a class or dictionary might be more suitable due to the information
          becoming harder to read the larger the tuples are. </p>

      <h2>Day 6 <span class="date">- 4 July, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed the first Python course on Boot.dev!</p>

        <img src="src/img/day-6.png" alt="A screenshot of Python course completed" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I'm finding that the most valuable learning moments often come <em>after</em> I've submitted my code, when
          I
          compare my approach to the suggested solutions. It's clear that my next step in development is to move from
          just 'making it work' to 'making it elegant'.<br><br>

          The AI chat (Boots) has proven very helpful throughout these lessons as it has access to the lesson content,
          your own solution and a suggested solution. Today, the AI chat tool told me about the simple | operator that
          merges two sets in a single character!<br><br>

          My following chat with the AI tool suggested an approach that I'll test out going forwards: Focus on
          identifying the core, uniform pattern of a task first, then handling the specifics or bugs afterwards. It
          suggested that this "general-to-specific" approach will help me write less redundant code. </p>

      <h2>Day 7 <span class="date">- 5 July, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Applied more Bootstrap techniques learn from the SheCodes course and completed the WSL2 setup for the
          upcoming Boot.dev course - I had nothing to be afraid of!</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Getting into Bootstrap, I'm realising how much more pratice I need in understanding documentation. There have
          been some details I've wanted to customise, but haven't figured out from the documentation how to
          achieve them in Bootstrap. I want to be able to refer solely to the documentation and not resort to asking AI
          or searching elsewhere for help; if I find myself needing or wanting to use Bootstrap in the future, I will
          need to dedicate time in experimenting with their classes, but for now I will just focus on getting
          enough done for completing the SheCodes course.
          <br><br>
          For developers that are familiar with Bootstrap, I can see how it would be a great tool for quickly getting a
          site up.

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>In today's session I chose to continue with my 'terminal journey' on boot.dev. I learnt about the
          10-character strings that indicate file permissions, and that you can chain options/commands (for lack of a
          better
          word) such as: <code>ls -l -d private/</code></p>

          can be easily accessed without remembering their location.</p>

        <p>Made a start on a guided python project in Boot.dev, and opened up Figma to start wireframing a redesign for
          my portfolio. </p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>A LOT of time was spent browsing ideas, but I tend to prefer the "neu-brutalist" style. I
          personally have a strong dislike for scrolling, so the portfolio has to be non-scrollable... maybe I'll
          brainstorm
          ways of making this log non-scrollable too... or is it possible to auto-scroll? a vertical carousel?</p>

        <p>Continued a little on the boot.dev guided project - it's making a bookbot. Today I added a function to count
          the words in the one book. The function is made up of 3 lines, the lesson advises to use split(), but if it
          hadn't advised me to do that, I can't say for sure what route I would have taken to figure it out!</p>

        <p>I'm struggling with using sort() for the boot.dev guided project, but I'm determined to keep referring to

            schools</a>, as reading through each of the exampls somehow made it click for me. This meant I could finish
          up the Readme file and complete this project!</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>It was a reminder that sometimes I just need things explained in a different way. The python documentation
          for this still doesn't make sense to me! I <em>reeeeaaally</em> want to play around with nlp for analysing the
          texts and adding to this project, but I think it would be sensible to continue with the basics.</p>

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Fit in some boot.dev and logging it before work because I feel like I'm going to finish late. One thing that
          I questioned is when instance variables should be declared. I'll put what Boots advised me here as it will be
          useful for me to refer back to (this is based on the code captured in the below image)</p>
        <h4>Instance Variables vs. Local Parameters</h4>



        <h5>Understanding the Differences</h5>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instance variables</strong> (like <code>self.target</code>) persist after the method finishes and
            can be
            accessed by other methods. They belong to the object itself.</li>
          <li><strong>Parameters</strong> (like <code>target</code>) only exist during the execution of that specific
            method
            call. They are temporary placeholders for values passed into a method.</li>
        </ul>



        <h4>When Should You Store Parameters as Instance Variables?</h4>

        <p>Only when you need to remember that information for later use in other methods.</p>


        <p>Consider the example of casting a fireball:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You <strong>don't need</strong> to remember who the target was after the fireball is cast.</li>
          <li>You <strong>don't need</strong> to remember the cost or damage values after the method completes.</li>
          <li>The fireball casting is a one-time action that happens and then it's done.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this scenario, storing <code>target</code>, <code>cost</code>, or <code>damage</code> as instance
          variables
          would be unnecessary, as their values are only relevant for the duration of the <code>fireball</code> casting
          method.</p>

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed the last chapter of the object oriented programming boot.dev course. I definitely need to revise it
          after looking at some other resources since I feel I'm only getting the gist, and was struggling to complete
          the lessons without the help of the Boot ai. </p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>It didn't click for me until seeing the solution above that setting the dunder methods override Python's
          built-in implementation - now I can see the point of them!</p>
