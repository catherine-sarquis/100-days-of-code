        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Finished the design for this simple log page, drawing inspiration from the
            neu-brutalist designs of the GumRoad and Codecademy sites. Aiming for a clean, readable layout.</li>
          <li>Completed a kata in Python and JS: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/555086d53eac039a2a000083"
              target="_blank">Opposites Attract</a></li>
          <li><b>SheCodes: </b>Practiced using elements of Bootstrap</li>
          <li><b>Boot.dev: </b>Completed a few Python lessons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Learnt about css variables, and managed to include some into this repo's css!</p>

      <h2>Day 2 <span class="date">- 30 June, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed a few lessons about Python - learnt a bit about binary, converted strings of binary into integers,
          learnt a bit about exponents and scientific notation.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Definitely need to practice these concepts more, maybe can find some codewars katas related to these areas.

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>In this hot weather, having short Boot.dev lesson to work through make it easier to meet my goal of learning
          code for at
          least an hour a day. Worked through the "Comparisons" chapter in Python.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I wouldn't usually have written the code as above, but
          I'm glad that I passed the tests for the exercise as it didn't come naturally to me to write it in one concise
          line.<br>
          I was surprised that the solution provided had the if statements listed separately and with no if-else
          statements.
          Apparently, this is known as the "early exit" pattern and is recommended for readability and makes it easier
          to maintain code.
