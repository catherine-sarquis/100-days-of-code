        <p>In this hot weather, having short Boot.dev lesson to work through make it easier to meet my goal of learning
          code for at
          least an hour a day. Worked through the "Comparisons" chapter in Python.</p>

        <img src="src/img/day-3.png" alt="A screen capture of checking conditions in Python" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I wouldn't usually have written the code as above, but
          I'm glad that I passed the tests for the exercise as it didn't come naturally to me to write it in one concise
          line.<br>
          I was surprised that the solution provided had the if statements listed separately and with no if-else
          statements.
          Apparently, this is known as the "early exit" pattern and is recommended for readability and makes it easier
          to maintain code.

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>In addition to practicing iterating over and slicing lists, I learnt about tuples and that they should only
          be used for a handful of items, otherwise a class or dictionary might be more suitable due to the information
          becoming harder to read the larger the tuples are. </p>

        <p>Completed the first Python course on Boot.dev!</p>

        <img src="src/img/day-6.png" alt="A screenshot of Python course completed" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I'm finding that the most valuable learning moments often come <em>after</em> I've submitted my code, when
          I
          compare my approach to the suggested solutions. It's clear that my next step in development is to move from
          just 'making it work' to 'making it elegant'.<br><br>

          The AI chat (Boots) has proven very helpful throughout these lessons as it has access to the lesson content,
          your own solution and a suggested solution. Today, the AI chat tool told me about the simple | operator that
          merges two sets in a single character!<br><br>

          My following chat with the AI tool suggested an approach that I'll test out going forwards: Focus on
          identifying the core, uniform pattern of a task first, then handling the specifics or bugs afterwards. It
          suggested that this "general-to-specific" approach will help me write less redundant code. </p>

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Applied more Bootstrap techniques learn from the SheCodes course and completed the WSL2 setup for the
          upcoming Boot.dev course - I had nothing to be afraid of!</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Getting into Bootstrap, I'm realising how much more pratice I need in understanding documentation. There have
          been some details I've wanted to customise, but haven't figured out from the documentation how to
          achieve them in Bootstrap. I want to be able to refer solely to the documentation and not resort to asking AI
          or searching elsewhere for help; if I find myself needing or wanting to use Bootstrap in the future, I will
          need to dedicate time in experimenting with their classes, but for now I will just focus on getting
          enough done for completing the SheCodes course.
          <br><br>
          For developers that are familiar with Bootstrap, I can see how it would be a great tool for quickly getting a
          site up.

        <p>In today's session I chose to continue with my 'terminal journey' on boot.dev. I learnt about the

        <p>A LOT of time was spent browsing ideas, but I tend to prefer the "neu-brutalist" style. I
          personally have a strong dislike for scrolling, so the portfolio has to be non-scrollable... maybe I'll
          brainstorm
          ways of making this log non-scrollable too... or is it possible to auto-scroll? a vertical carousel?</p>

          hadn't advised me to do that, I can't say for sure what route I would have taken to figure it out!</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>It was a reminder that sometimes I just need things explained in a different way. The python documentation
          for this still doesn't make sense to me! I <em>reeeeaaally</em> want to play around with nlp for analysing the
          texts and adding to this project, but I think it would be sensible to continue with the basics.</p>

        <p>Fit in some boot.dev and logging it before work because I feel like I'm going to finish late. One thing that
          I questioned is when instance variables should be declared. I'll put what Boots advised me here as it will be
          useful for me to refer back to (this is based on the code captured in the below image)</p>
        <h4>Instance Variables vs. Local Parameters</h4>



        <h5>Understanding the Differences</h5>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Instance variables</strong> (like <code>self.target</code>) persist after the method finishes and
            can be
            accessed by other methods. They belong to the object itself.</li>
          <li><strong>Parameters</strong> (like <code>target</code>) only exist during the execution of that specific
            method
            call. They are temporary placeholders for values passed into a method.</li>
        </ul>



        <h4>When Should You Store Parameters as Instance Variables?</h4>

        <p>Only when you need to remember that information for later use in other methods.</p>


        <p>Consider the example of casting a fireball:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You <strong>don't need</strong> to remember who the target was after the fireball is cast.</li>
          <li>You <strong>don't need</strong> to remember the cost or damage values after the method completes.</li>
          <li>The fireball casting is a one-time action that happens and then it's done.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In this scenario, storing <code>target</code>, <code>cost</code>, or <code>damage</code> as instance
          variables
          would be unnecessary, as their values are only relevant for the duration of the <code>fireball</code> casting
          method.</p>

        <p>Completed the last chapter of the object oriented programming boot.dev course. I definitely need to revise it
          after looking at some other resources since I feel I'm only getting the gist, and was struggling to complete

        <p>Today I'm working on completing my improved portfolio site to submit for tomorrow's SheCodes deadline. Last
          night, I added some JavaScript to add and remove a class name to the nav link that was active, but each time I
          clicked on the other link, the page refreshed and the class lost. </p>
        <p>I got a completely different solution from AI, which worked, and I've learnt that I understand things better
          with a lot of practice, and so after copying the code from AI a couple of times; with a blank JS file, I asked

          I used <code>git-filter-repo</code> [using pip install via a codespace] to remove the 'Storyline Portfolio/'
          and 'assets/' folders from my entire
          commit history. Here are the main commands I used in sequence:
        </p>
        <p><strong>1. Rewrite History:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>git filter-repo --path 'Storyline Portfolio/' --path 'assets/' --invert-paths --force</code></pre>

        <p><strong>2. Finalise Deletion:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>git gc --prune=now --aggressive</code></pre>

        <p><strong>3. Update GitHub:</strong></p>
        <pre><code>git remote add origin &lt;your-repo-url&gt;
            git push origin --force --all</code></pre>
        <p>
          After the process, I ran <code>git count-objects -vH</code> to check the size again. Voila! The repo had
          shrunk to
          a tiny 256 KiB. Then, I made a fresh clone of the repo and continued working as normal from the new clone.

          After a lesson on boot.dev, I realised my Git history was full of old, heavy portfolio files. I worried they
          were
          bloating my web hosting deployments, so I decided to clean up. My repo was about 15 MiB – big enough to
          call in
          the Men in Black? The funny thing is, I now realise this wouldn't have affected my hosting
          limits. Website deployments only use files from your most recent commit, completely ignoring the
          <code>.git</code>
          history folder!

        <p>Spent the morning making tweaks to my portfolio, and since this is going to be an ongoing project, I've
          decided to submit it as I feel it's <em>good enough.</em> In the afternoon I picked up the next SheCodes

          creating a css header hero and html embeds.</p>

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>With slightly blurry eyes and a slightly blurry mind after work today, I looked briefly at inheritance again
          in some Boot.dev lessons - looking at super keyword in a child class to access its parent; super() to call the
          parent's initial contructor; and super.method() for calling a parent's method and adding to its logic instead
          of completely replacing it. </p>

        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Worked through a couple of Boot.dev lessons: I found it interesting learning a bit about javascript
          prototypes - basically, every JS object has a prototype, each leading up a chain to the root Object whose
          prototype is null.<br><br>
          Objects store references to their prototypes, not actual copies of their properties.<br><br>
          When accessing a property, JS first checks the object itself, then walks up its prototype chain until it fincs
          the property or reaches null.<br><br>
          Object.create() creates a new object with the specified prototype - establishing the prototype relationship
          (not copying properties as mentioned) <br><br>
          Object.getPrototypeOf() returns the prototype of an object - providing a way to inspect the prototype
          chain.<br><br>
          These appear to be the foundations of JavaScript's object system, I've added these points to my list of things
          to go back to better understand how and why they're used.

        <p>Practiced JS loops with Boot.dev, and made a start with the guided project for the SheCodes Responsive
          Add-on. While I find it relaxing copying a figma design, I don't find this module beneficial in terms of
          learning
          anything new, but as it's a one-page site, it might be a good project to try to provide translated pages

        <p>Made some more progress on turning the provided Figma design into a webpage project and took a look online to
          find out how I can add multiple languages. I think I can find the user's preferred browser language and
          provide a dropdown list of languages also - it seems like an easy way of achieving this is by putting each
          language's index.html in its own directory. Apparently, if I find the right html code to use, it should
          automatically set any right-to-left language also, meaning that setting an Arabic page could be a good test of
          the CSS I've written!

          I tried it out last year and a year or so prior, but was completely baffled by the first lecture. This time
          I've enjoyed it, so will try to add this to my learning resources also. I'm writing this super quickly before
          it hits midnight because I've almost found the spot in the window.location node that I need in order to change

        <p>Tidied up the SheCodes Responsive Add-on project by adjusting the colour palette, improved the functionality
          of the dropdown for selecting a translated page by marking that page's respective option as selected and
          disabled since that was the only solution I was able to implement. Although I used a font that I'm sure
          supported various weights for Arabic, the <code>strong</code> tag wasn't applying a heavier
          weight. I also needed to set any latin text as <code>dir="ltr"</code> on the Arabic page as well as making the
          Arabic font-size larger and reducing the size of the latin text. I'm sure there are better and recommended
          ways of working with other languages! Adding to my list of things to do: inspect some Arabic websites to see
          their set up.

          I also realised that my weather app wasn't responsive because I
          didn't want to use Bootstrap! So next I'll work on cleaning up the html and css for that project as well as

          After several days away from my daily coding challenge, I've had a chance to reflect on my goals and reset
          my
          intentions. While I wasn't actively logging my coding sessions, I did work through some online
          exercises, but
          nothing of note.
          <br>
          I realised I mostly needed time to reflect on and refresh my intentions, as well as on my habits and
          consistency
          in other areas of my life. This also happened to coincide with a reflective survey after passing my
          probation
          period at work… basically, lots of reflection happening all over.
          <br>
          I always thought it was intention that inspired action, but my 42-day coding streak suggested something new to
          me:
          intention just isn't enough on its own. The consistency wasn't just fueled by my dream of a tech role; it was
          also because I
          have a clear goal, a public log to track my progress, and a system that makes it easy to do every day. A key
          point to note is that this challenge is been one of which my intentions, my passions, and a supportive system
          all aligned perfectly.
          <br>
          When I look at other areas of my life, those key ingredients are often missing. My pause turned out to
          actually be a chance (unbeknownst to me) to understand what made my coding challenge successful so I can
          bring that
          same
          structure and clarity to everything else I want to achieve.
          <br>
          I'm gaining a renewed sense of purpose and clearing the path forward a bit. As a way to get back
          into my
          logs, here are some of the things I've been up to during this pause:

        <ul>
          <li>I listened in on a technical resume review session and was so inspired by others' impressive
            CVs.
          </li>
          <li>I thought up some new activities that I'm excited to build for my project.</li>
          <li>Although I have zero experience with it, I think a NoSQL database could be a good fit for
            this
            projec idea, allowing me to easily record different information for each lemma.</li>

          After searching online through maaaany examples, I realised I needed to await the response - not only

          The last few days, I've been trying to get my head around putting a weather app I previously built in vanilla
          JS into react. I got stuck
          because I don't know enough! I've temporarily filled in the gaps with some searching and YouTube tutorials. I
          needed to understand useEffect and useState a bit better, and how it would be possible to keep the searchform
          as a component - but have it still affect the state in the parent App.jsx file. I've managed to work it out
          now based on an example I found - but there's no way I'd be able to repeat this without a lot of searching
          again... lots of repetition
          needed which would be a challenge for the flashcard app actually.
