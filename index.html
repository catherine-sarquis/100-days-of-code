        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Finished the design for this simple log page, drawing inspiration from the
            neu-brutalist designs of the GumRoad and Codecademy sites. Aiming for a clean, readable layout.</li>
          <li>Completed a kata in Python and JS: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/555086d53eac039a2a000083"
              target="_blank">Opposites Attract</a></li>
          <li><b>SheCodes: </b>Practiced using elements of Bootstrap</li>
          <li><b>Boot.dev: </b>Completed a few Python lessons</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Learnt about css variables, and managed to include some into this repo's css!</p>

      <h2>Day 2 <span class="date">- 30 June, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed a few lessons about Python - learnt a bit about binary, converted strings of binary into integers,
          learnt a bit about exponents and scientific notation.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>Definitely need to practice these concepts more, maybe can find some codewars katas related to these areas.

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>In this hot weather, having short Boot.dev lesson to work through make it easier to meet my goal of learning
          code for at
          least an hour a day. Worked through the "Comparisons" chapter in Python.</p>

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>I wouldn't usually have written the code as above, but
          I'm glad that I passed the tests for the exercise as it didn't come naturally to me to write it in one concise
          line.<br>
          I was surprised that the solution provided had the if statements listed separately and with no if-else
          statements.
          Apparently, this is known as the "early exit" pattern and is recommended for readability and makes it easier
          to maintain code.

      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>90 mins on Boot.dev working through the first Python course, I'm finding the exercises great practice &
          revision.</p>

    <div class="log-entry">
      <h2>Day 5 <span class="date">- 3 July, 2025</span></h2>
      <div class="progress">
        <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
        <p>Completed the Python course section on Lists</p>

        <img src="src/img/day 5.png" alt="A screenshot of Lists lessons completed" />

        <h3>Thoughts:</h3>
        <p>In addition to practicing iterating over and slicing lists, I learnt about tuples and that they should only
          be used for a handful of items, otherwise a class or dictionary might be more suitable due to the information
          becoming harder to read the larger the tuples are. </p>
