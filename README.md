# My 100 Days of Code Log

This repository serves as my personal log for the #100DaysOfCode challenge. It's a public commitment to code for at least an hour every day for 100 days.

As part of this challenge, I aim to:  
⬜ complete the SheCodes Bootcamp course  
✅ complete Boot.dev 'Learn to Code in Python'

## About the Project

This log is designed in a clean, easy-to-read neu-brutalist style, inspired by the Codecademy and Gumroad websites. The focus is on clear typography and a high-contrast and minimalist aesthetic.

## How to Use

To start your own log, simply fork this repository and edit the `index.html` file. Each day, you will add a new `.log-entry` div to document your progress.

A template for a new entry is provided below:

```html
<div class="log-entry">
  <h2>Day X <span class="date">- Day Month, Year</span></h2>
  <div class="progress">
    <h3>Today's Progress:</h3>
    <p>A brief description of what you worked on and the progress you made.</p>
